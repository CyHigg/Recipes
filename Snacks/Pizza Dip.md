> ### 💡 Technical Note: Customizations & Aesthetics
> * **Protein Swaps**: 1/2 lb of cooked ground Italian sausage can be used in place of, or in addition to, the pepperoni.
> * **Visual Contrast**: For a more colorful dish, use a 50/50 mix of red and orange bell peppers.
> * **Texture**: Canned mushrooms can be added for extra texture if desired.
