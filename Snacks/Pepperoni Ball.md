## Instructions

- [ ] **Prepare Cream Cheese**: In a large bowl, use a fork to mash the softened cream cheese until it reaches a smooth, workable consistency.

- [ ] **Mix Ingredients**: Add the chopped green onions, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, Accent seasoning, and the main portion of the pepperoni to the bowl.
- [ ] **Integrate**: Mix thoroughly until the seasonings and proteins are evenly distributed throughout the cream cheese.
- [ ] **Form & Coat**: Form the mixture into a uniform ball. Roll the ball in the reserved pepperoni until the entire exterior is coated.
- [ ] **Chill**: Place in the refrigerator and chill for at least one hour to allow the ball to set.
