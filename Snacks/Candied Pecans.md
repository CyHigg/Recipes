> ### 💡 Technical Note: Frothy Egg Whites
> When whisking the egg white and water, continue until the mixture is **frothy and bubbly**. This ensures the coating adheres to the pecans evenly and creates the desired "crunch" once baked.

## Instructions

- [ ] **Prepare Dry Coating**: In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Set aside.
- [ ] **Aerate Wet Base**: In a large bowl, whisk the egg white and water together until the mixture is frothy.
- [ ] **Coat Nuts**: Toss the pecans into the egg white mixture. Mix thoroughly until every nut is well-coated.
- [ ] **Apply Sugar**: Slowly add the dry sugar mixture to the large bowl. Manually mix until the pecans are evenly coated.
- [ ] **Setup Sheet**: Spread the pecans onto a parchment-lined baking sheet in a single, even layer.
- [ ] **Initial Bake**: Bake for 10 minutes. 
- [ ] **Active Baking Phase**: Remove from oven, stir/rearrange the pecans, and return to the oven. Continue this process every 10–15 minutes for a total of 30–50 minutes.
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Remove once the pecans are evenly browned and the coating has set.
- [ ] **Cooling**: Let the pecans cool completely on the sheet to allow the candy shell to harden.

## 🛠 Optional Variation: Salt Toggling
If producing multiple batches, vary the salt levels between batches to create an alternating sweet and savory profile for a more complex snack mix.
