> ### 💡 Technical Note: Butter & Flour Precision
> * **Butter Tempering**: Butter must be softened enough to cut with a knife with minimal resistance. Avoid "soupy" or melted butter. If microwaving, use 10-second bursts only.
> * **Flour Aeration**: Pour flour into a separate bowl to fluff. Spoon into the measuring cup and level off with the flat edge of a butter knife. Do not pack.

## Instructions

- [ ] **Prepare Dry Base**: In a medium bowl, combine flour, salt, and baking soda. Set aside.
- [ ] **Emulsify Fats**: In a large bowl, combine peanut butter and softened butter. Blend on medium-high until the texture is silky.
- [ ] **Cream Sugars**: Add light brown and white sugars to the fat mixture. Mix until light and fluffy.
- [ ] **Add Wet Ingredients**: Mix in the egg and vanilla extract. Ensure the egg is fully incorporated and the mixture is smooth.
- [ ] **Manual Integration (Critical)**: Slowly add dry ingredients. **Switch to a mixing spoon and mix manually** until a batter just forms. 
    * *Warning: Do not overmix! Overmixing develops gluten and will ruin the S-Tier texture.*
- [ ] **Forming**: Roll into walnut-sized balls. Manually press 10 peanut butter chips into each ball.
- [ ] **Placement**: Space 3 inches apart on a parchment-lined sheet. Place on the middle oven rack.
- [ ] **First Stage Bake**: Bake for **XX minutes**.
- [ ] **Rotation & Flattening**: Rotate the pan 180 degrees. While turning, gently lift and drop the baking sheet against the rack to flatten the cookies.
- [ ] **Final Stage Bake**: Continue baking for **XX minutes** until lightly browned.
- [ ] **Rest & Cool**: Remove from oven. **Let cookies cool on the sheet for 10 minutes** before moving to a rack. This setting period is vital for the cookie's structural integrity.
