> ### 💡 Technical Note: Butter & Flour Precision
> * **Butter Tempering**: Butter must be softened enough to cut with a knife with minimal resistance. Avoid "soupy" or melted butter. If microwaving, use 5-second bursts only.
> * **Flour Aeration**: Pour flour into a separate bowl to fluff. Spoon into the measuring cup and level off with the flat edge of a butter knife. Do not pack.

## 🛠 Optional Patch: Cinnamon Sugar Dusting
For added texture and flavor, follow these steps once the cookies are **completely cooled**:

1.  **Prep Mixture**: Combine 2 tablespoons of sugar and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon in a gallon-sized freezer bag.
2.  **Coat**: Place up to 12 cooled cookies into the bag at a time.
3.  **Dust**: Gently shake the bag to coat all sides of the cookies. **Do not over-handle**, as the potato chip structure can make these cookies delicate.
4.  **Repeat**: Continue until all cookies are coated.
