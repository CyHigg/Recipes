> ### 💡 Technical Note: Butter & Flour Precision
> * **Butter Tempering**: Butter must be softened enough to cut with a knife with minimal resistance. Avoid "soupy" or melted butter. If microwaving, use 5-second bursts only.
> * **Flour Aeration**: Pour flour into a separate bowl to fluff. Spoon into the measuring cup and level off with the flat edge of a butter knife. Do not pack.

## Instructions

- [ ] **Setup Sprinkles**: Pour half the bottle of non-pareils into a cereal bowl. Pour slowly to prevent them from bouncing out.  Refill bowl as needed.
- [ ] **Prepare Dry Base**: In a medium bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and baking soda. Set aside.
- [ ] **Cream Fats & Sugar**: In a large bowl, combine softened butter and sugar. Blend on medium-high until the texture is silky.
- [ ] **Add Wet Ingredients**: Mix in the egg and vanilla extract until smooth and fully incorporated.
- [ ] **Manual Integration**: Slowly add dry ingredients. **Switch to a mixing spoon and mix manually** until a dough forms.
- [ ] **Press & Coat**: Roll dough into walnut-sized balls. Press one side of the ball into the sprinkles, pressing down until it forms a "pancake" shape.
- [ ] **Placement (Critical Spacing)**: Place cookies **5 inches apart** on parchment-lined sheets. These cookies spread significantly; do not let them overlap.
- [ ] **First Stage Bake**: Bake for **XX minutes** in the middle of the oven rack.
- [ ] **Rotation & Flattening**: Rotate the pan 180 degrees. While turning, gently lift and drop the baking sheet against the rack to flatten.
- [ ] **Final Stage Bake**: Continue baking for **XX minutes** until lightly browned.
- [ ] **Rest & Cool**: Remove from oven. Let cookies rest on the sheet for a few minutes before transferring to a baking rack.
