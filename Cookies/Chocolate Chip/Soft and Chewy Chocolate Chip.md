> ### 💡 Technical Note: Butter & Flour Precision
> * **Butter Tempering**: Butter must be softened enough to cut with a knife with minimal resistance. Avoid "soupy" or melted butter. If microwaving, use 10-second bursts only.
> * **Flour Aeration**: Pour flour into a separate bowl to fluff. Spoon into the measuring cup and level off with the flat edge of a butter knife. Do not pack.

## Instructions

- [ ] **Cream Sugars**: Combine softened butter, light brown sugar, and white sugar in a large bowl. Mix on medium-high until pale and fluffy.
- [ ] **Wet Ingredients**: Add eggs, egg yolks, and vanilla extract. Mix until incorporated.
- [ ] **Dry Ingredients**: Slowly add the precision-measured flour, corn starch, salt, and baking soda to the mix.
- [ ] **Forming**: Roll dough into walnut-sized balls. Manually add 10 chocolate chips per ball to ensure even distribution across all units.
- [ ] **Placement**: Place cookie balls 3 inches apart on parchment-lined sheets. Place in the middle of the oven rack.
- [ ] **First Stage Bake**: Bake for **XX minutes**.
- [ ] **Rotation & Flattening**: Rotate the pan 180 degrees. While turning, gently lift the baking sheet and drop it against the oven rack. This "pan-bang" flattens the cookies for the correct texture.
- [ ] **Final Stage Bake**: Continue baking for **XX minutes** until lightly browned.
- [ ] **Cooling**: Remove from oven. Let rest for 1 minute before transferring to a baking rack.
