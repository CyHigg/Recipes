# Open-Source Recipes 

### The Mission: No Ads. No Stories. Just Food.

I built this repository because I was tired of digging through commercial recipe websites filled with:
* ❌ Intrusive popup ads and trackers.
* ❌ 2,000-word "backstories" about the author's childhood or how much their family loves this recipe.
* ❌ Unnecessary cooking theory bloat.

**This repo provides:**
1.  **A picture** of the final "build."
2.  **A straightforward description** of the product.
3.  **A shopping list** categorized for a quick grocery run.
4.  **To the point Instructions**: Precise, step-by-step "source code" for your kitchen.

## 💡 Core Technical Standards
All recipes in this repository assume the following "Global Config" unless otherwise stated:
* **Aerate your flour**: Never scoop from the bag.
* **Temper your butter**: Softened, never soupy.
* **Precision Leveling**: Use the flat edge of a butter knife for all dry measurements.
